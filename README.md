Data Science MeetUp @CashStar 20180809

Please note, this notebook was created using AWS SageMaker, and must be uploaded to SageMaker in order to train/deploy the model.
While it is entirely possible to develop this process to work locally, the point of this tutorial was to demonstrate using the 
SageMaker environment from end to end.
